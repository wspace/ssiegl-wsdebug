wsdebug - The Whitespace Debugger

wsdebug is a debugger for the whitespace[1] programming language. On the
whole it's something quite like the GNU debugger 'gdb'. However not so
bulky and featurerich. 

In fact it's just a little tool, aiming to help out if you got lost
somewhere in your Whitespace code. If you get to the point where you
can't remember the whole stack and heap, just call this fancy tool,
step to where you lost the way and glance at the stack (or heap).

In future releases I even want to supply an editing thingy, so you
can easily manipulate stack as well as heap memory. In the long run
I'd like to have some state-storing mechanism := so you are able to
say 'save state now', debugging somewhere in the program and step 
from there. Then enter 'restore' and try stepping from there again :)

You wonder why your interpreter just stops working somewhere, but
don't have a clue, where? - execute with wsdebug and have a look.

You got some funny or obscure code, you'd like to share?

Hey, please mail it to me, I'm rather interested in such (weird) stuff. 
If you want me to put it into some archives on wsdebug homepage, don't
hesitate, but ask me to.
